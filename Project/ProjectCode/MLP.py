"""Description:
The train.py is to build your CNN model, train the model, and save it for later evaluation(marking)
This is just a simple template, you feel free to change it according to your own style.
However, you must make sure:
1. Your own model is saved to the directory "model" and named as "model.h5"
2. The "test.py" must work properly with your model, this will be used by tutors for marking.
3. If you have added any extra pre-processing steps, please make sure you also implement them in "test.py" so that they can later be applied to test images.
